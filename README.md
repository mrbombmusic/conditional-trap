# conditional-trap
A Trap beat made in Sonic Pi which switches between parts by just changing a conditional variable


In order for this code to work, you must download the audio sample files onto your own computer and replace the path to those files' directory accordingly in your own code. The variables for these files are:

kicks = 'your file directory path' 
snares = 'your file directory path' 
hats = 'your file directory path'

The kicks, snare and hihats have multiple files in each folder while the bass is one single audio file. The drum sounds are a part of an 808 drum sample packet that I downloaded for free at: https://soundpacks.com/free-sound-packs/808-drum-kit/
